# Comparative Effectiveness of Alternative Intervals between First and Second Doses of the mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines: a Trial Emulation Approach
Thie GitHub repository includes R scripts that were used to run the clone-censor weight analyses for our manuscript entitled “Comparative Effectiveness of Alternative Intervals between First and Second Doses of the mRNA COVID-19 Vaccines: a Trial Emulation Approach.” 

# R scripts
- main.R: This script runs the main analysis for the manuscript for both Pfizer-BioNTech recipients and Moderna recipients.
- func.create.clones.R: This script will be loaded and used in the other script "mian.R" to create a clone for each of the protocols.
